# Minecraft Mod Orchestra

**A local-first orchestration foundation for turning Minecraft Java ideas into managed Fabric mod projects.**

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-Python%20unit%20tests-informational)](#testing) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0--prealpha-yellow) ![Loader](https://img.shields.io/badge/loader-Fabric-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

> **Status: Pre-alpha, working foundation—not a finished AI mod factory.** The current executable app can collect requirements, track tasks and approvals, produce simple Fabric **item/block source**, generate deterministic 16×16 placeholder textures, validate the output, inspect the environment, and request an explicitly approved local Gradle build. It **cannot yet turn an arbitrary creative prompt into an automatically implemented, game-tested mod**. Minecraft itself was not available to run build/runtime tests in the development environment.

## Architecture commitments

- **Hybrid local-first:** Fabric workspaces, Gradle, Blockbench and future game tests stay local. Claude Code is an optional *developer integration*, not a required application dependency.
- **Fabric-first:** one narrowly scoped, pinned `fabric-1.21.1-candidate` profile mirroring the official FabricMC example mod (Mojang mappings, Loom 1.18, Gradle 9.7.1). The upstream template has been build-verified locally; *generated output has not yet been compiled*.
- **Approval autonomy:** reviewers approve the specification and any Gradle execution; source files are only generated in a new/empty folder; no silent executable installation, publishing or Minecraft save modification.
- **Evidence instead of wishful thinking:** `SOURCE_GENERATED_UNVERIFIED`, `BUILD_PASSED_GAME_UNTESTED`, and separate QA tasks are distinct outcomes.

## What works now

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| CLI (`craftctl`) and a local browser UI | **Implemented, exercised** |
| Read-only environment inspection | **Implemented, tested** |
| Deterministic idea interpretation (`items: ...; blocks: ...`) | **Implemented, tested** |
| Persistent SQLite projects, events, tasks and leases | **Implemented, tested** |
| User-spec approval + operation-scoped, one-use build approval | **Implemented, tested** |
| Fabric source generation, pixel-art placeholders, Java/resources | **Implemented, statically tested** |
| SHA-256 file manifest and static JSON/resource existence validation | **Implemented, tested** |
| One-use, explicitly authorized Gradle build invocation | **Implemented; not exercised against Minecraft here** |
| Restricted MCP interface (read-only tools plus approved source generation) | **Implemented, protocol smoke-tested** |
| 12 reusable Skills (one per role in `capabilities.py`) | **Included; `.claude/agents/` subagent files not yet written (R2)** |
| GeckoLib mob modeling, Blockbench MCP, fully automatic worlds | **Planned / not integrated** |
| Real Minecraft GameTest, gameplay and multiplayer proof | **Not integrated** |
| Windows installer/managed JDK/Gradle provisioning | **Planned** |

## Quick start — Windows 11 / PowerShell

Install **Python 3.11+** (required to run the Orchestra itself, not to compile Minecraft). No Minecraft, JDK, Blockbench or Gradle are needed just to try the idea/plan/source flow.

```powershell
# Unzip this repo; open PowerShell in its directory
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e .
craftctl doctor
craftctl ui
```

The UI prints a **localhost-only URL containing an ephemeral authentication token**. Open it in your browser; create a mod, inspect its specification, approve it and generate source. The generated workspace is under `%USERPROFILE%\.minecraft-mod-orchestra\projects\<mod_id>` unless you set `CRAFTCTL_HOME`.

### Run through the CLI instead

```powershell
craftctl new --name "Crystal Frontier" --id crystal_frontier --package com.example.crystalfrontier --idea "items: sky crystal, lunar gem; blocks: crystal stone"
craftctl plan crystal_frontier
craftctl approve-spec crystal_frontier
craftctl generate crystal_frontier
craftctl validate crystal_frontier
craftctl status crystal_frontier
craftctl footprint crystal_frontier
```

**Intent syntax today:** `items: moon shard, crystal rod; blocks: carved slate, ore rock`. Unsupported advanced ideas (e.g. `boss`, `biome`, `dimension`, `GeckoLib animation`) generate blocking questions; they are **not** silently substituted with a basic item.

### Build the generated Fabric mod

Building requires **JDK 25** (Gradle 9.7.1 + Loom 1.18 runtime; sources target Java 21), Gradle or a reviewed Gradle wrapper, a network connection for initial dependency resolution, and your explicit one-time approval. The generated source currently **does not include a Gradle wrapper JAR**; see `docs/SETUP.md` for why and how to bootstrap one from trusted sources.

```powershell
craftctl request-build crystal_frontier
craftctl approvals crystal_frontier
craftctl decide <approval-id> grant
craftctl build crystal_frontier --approval-id <approval-id>
craftctl logs crystal_frontier
```

A Gradle build runs project code **without OS-level sandboxing in this pre-alpha**. Review Gradle files, JDK and wrapper before approving. Build success is not gameplay success; test in an isolated Minecraft instance before shipping.

## Integrate with Claude Code (advanced, optional)

This repository contains `.mcp.json`, `skills/`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code subagent definitions (`.claude/agents/`) are **not shipped yet**; they are an R2 deliverable (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATH.md`). After installing `craftctl` into an environment available to Claude Code, open the repository using Claude Code and verify the `minecraft-orchestra` MCP server appears. The MCP exposes only typed diagnostic/project/plan/generate/footprint/validation tools—**not user approval-granting tools, arbitrary shell execution, or Blockbench by default**.

The agent roles and skills are prompts/playbooks, not an implemented provider-independent execution sandbox or autonomous planner yet. When agents work on a mod, review `docs/SECURITY.md` first.

## Repository map

```text

```

## Testing

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests check intake, generated JSON/PNG/file integrity, safe workspace paths, task leases, approvals, MCP tool restrictions and CLI end-to-end creation. CI does **not** run Gradle or Minecraft; that remains an explicit milestone.

## Project status, development and contributions

The master architectural plan from the research review is in `docs/MASTER_PLAN_v2.md`; the forward execution plan is `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PATH.md` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` is kept as history). The origin audit includes [Universal Modder](https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder), Fabric's [official example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod), [GeckoLib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) and Blockbench MCP candidates. **These projects are not bundled or executed**; provider adoption requires license and safety review.

All ordinary Python dependencies are standard-library modules. `pip install -e .` uses `setuptools` packaging; users need a working Python packaging environment. Local state/credentials are not included in the Git repo or ZIP.

## Honest limitations

1. **No guaranteed Fabric JAR build yet:** the toolchain is verified via the upstream template, but the generator's own output has not been compiled against it. The Gradle wrapper JAR cannot be bundled without a verified source.
2. **No automatic third-party software installers yet:** first-run checks and actionable instructions exist, but managed installation is a later milestone.
3. **No arbitrary natural language auto-coding yet:** advanced ideas are still tasks for Claude Code workers or human developers. No OpenAI/Anthropic API account is required to use deterministic mode.
4. **Local web UI is a developer prototype:** token-authenticated localhost, not a hardened multiuser desktop product. Disable port forwarding and do not expose it to the LAN/internet.
5. **No security sandbox:** agent prompts and MCP permission lists are *not* isolation. Launch untrusted code only in a real sandbox/VM after explicit approval.

### Coordinator and knowledge commands

```powershell
craftctl capabilities
craftctl next crystal_frontier
craftctl handoff crystal_frontier crystal_frontier:BUILD
craftctl kb-search "fabric loom profile"
craftctl footprint crystal_frontier --write
```

These provide bounded developer-facing task packets and reference lookup. They **do not automatically spawn model workers** or bypass approvals. In a future agent-adapter milestone, `handoff` will feed a supervised Claude Code worker with scoped task permissions.

### Bounded build diagnostics

`craftctl logs <mod-id>` shows a limited build-log tail, and `craftctl diagnose <mod-id>` classifies familiar Gradle, Java compilation, Mixin, registry, resource and GeckoLib error patterns. These are **heuristics**, not a full debugger or automatic repair; continuous in-game log collection is still planned.

## Push this project to GitHub

After extracting the ZIP and reviewing the source:

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Mod Orchestra pre-alpha"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

Create the empty GitHub repository first and replace the placeholder remote. Do **not** commit your local `CRAFTCTL_HOME` projects, credentials or Minecraft saves.
